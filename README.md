# Samsung WiFi Audio integration with Smarthings

This integration controls Samsung WiFi Speakers and Soundbars with "Multiroom" capabilities  It has been tested on the Samsung HS-MS650 Soundbar and the R1 Speaker.  It is expected to run on any of the Samsung Multiroom compatible speakers.

# Capabilities

a.  Music playback control

b.  Device control (volume, mute, audio source, equalizer preset)

c.  8 Presets.  Ability to set-up and then call up presets for channel or music playback.

d.  3 Group Presets per speaker.

e.  Audio Notification AND the ability to take a custom Text-To-Speech command with user-selected voices.

This device handler for SmartThings integration was completed using the commands from Port 55001, as defined at the site "https://sites.google.com/site/moosyresearch/projects/samsung_shape".  My appreciation for the many participants in that effort for their instrumental research and discoveries.
