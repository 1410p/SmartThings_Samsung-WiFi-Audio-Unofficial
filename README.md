# Samsung-Multiroom-WiFi-Soundbar-SmartThings-Integration
Beta version of the Samsung WiFi

The Samsung WiFi Soundbars are a member of the Samsung Multiroom Speakers.  This device handler for SmartThings integration was completed using the commands from Port 55001, as defined at the site "https://sites.google.com/site/moosyresearch/projects/samsung_shape".  My appreciation for the many participants in that effort for their instrumental research and discoveries.
