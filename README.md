# Samsung-Multiroom-WiFi-Soundbar-SmartThings-Integration
Beta version of the Samsung WiFi

The Samsung WiFi Soundbars are a member of the Samsung Multiroom Speakers.  This device handler for SmartThings integration was completed using the commands from Port 55001, as defined at the site "https://sites.google.com/site/moosyresearch/projects/samsung_shape".  My appreciation for the many participants in that effort for their instrumental research and discoveries.

#  Updates
10-08 - Refined Speaker Support.

# Integration Capabilities.

This integration provides the following capabilities:

a.  Soundbar control:  power, source, mute, volume, treble, bass, and rear level.

b.  Player control: play/pause, previous, next, shuffle, and repeat.

# Tile Definitions

This Device Handler has the following keys outside of the music control area:

  a)  Active/Standby: (left top corner).  Places speakers into pause and soundbars off.
