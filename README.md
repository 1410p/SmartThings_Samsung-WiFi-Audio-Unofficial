# Samsung-WiFi-Soundbar-Speaker-with-SmartThings-Integration

This device handler controls a stand-alone Samsung WiFi soundbar or speaker.  It has been tested on the Samsung HS-MS650 Soundbar and the R1 Speaker.  It is expected to run on any of the Samsung Multiroom compatible speakers.  If not, I will work to upgrade.

# Capabilities

a.  Music playback control

b.  Device control (volume, mute, audio source, equalizer preset)

c.  8 Presets.  Ability to set-up and then call up presets for channel or music playback.

This device handler for SmartThings integration was completed using the commands from Port 55001, as defined at the site "https://sites.google.com/site/moosyresearch/projects/samsung_shape".  My appreciation for the many participants in that effort for their instrumental research and discoveries.

#  Updates
10-11 - Tuned all functions for better performance.  Completed R1 speaker validation.  Added two presets.


  
#  Next Update

In next update, the plan is to incorporate a more automated (and user friendly) means of creating presets.

# Installation Instruction

Included in Documentation folder.
